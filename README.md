#**My first Web-Portfolio**

**idea and inspiration**
Upon engaging in numerous readings and discussions during this course, I realized that a webpage functions as a digital canvas where individuals can exhibit their creativity and artistic perspectives, especially when constructing a personal profile. Given the accessibility for individuals to create their own websites, I firmly believe that a website possesses immense potential in enabling individuals to express their ideas and effectively communicate with a wider community. Driven by this ambitious mindset, I was enthusiastic about infusing my distinct design viewpoint into the construction of my personal website.

I played an active role in creating all the visual components and design aspects of the website. Drawing inspiration from the Bauhaus movement, which originated in Germany, I envisioned utilizing primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. One aspect that captivates me about this movement is its pioneering stance on aiming to achieve through different forms of art such as architecture, innovative functionality, simplicity, collaborative efforts, and experimentation, while also emphasizing accessible and interactive design that would advocate for social progress. I consider it a daring artistic statement, and I desired my website to effectively convey my inclination towards this artistic vision. Another intriguing element that I wanted to incorporate into my website is my curated playlist. Music holds immense significance in my life, as I believe it serves as a powerful means of reflecting my current state of mind. Thus, I considered it a captivating idea to feature my collection of favorite songs, allowing users to explore and the music that resonates with me at the moment.

**challenges**
While developing this website, I encountered several challenges along the way. One of the main difficulties arose from my utilization of Bootstrap, a framework that posed complexities in aligning it with my specific vision. To overcome this hurdle, I dedicated a significant amount of time to exploring various websites and gathering inspiration from online sources. Although many online platforms had a commercial focus, it was the websites of different artists presented in our class that truly inspired me. I deeply admired their ability to embrace artistic freedom and develop their own distinctive patterns.

However, as I lacked a strong background in coding and working with JavaScript libraries, I faced particular challenges in implementing interactive features that aligned with my design aspirations. Despite these obstacles, I remained determined to create an engaging and visually appealing website that would effectively communicate my artistic vision.

Overall, this portfolio website is a testament to my journey in the Communications Lab, highlighting my dedication to artistic expression, and my commitment to developing a visually captivating and meaningful online presence. I am looking forward to using this foundational knowledge from the class and learning how to express my own creativity in digital and interactive environments.
